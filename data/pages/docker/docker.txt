====Docker====
  * One process per container (usually). Containers exists while processes inside of them are running. Once they stop the container will stop as well.
  * Only top layer is writable using the Union Mounts
  * **PID1** (ProcessID1 inside a container) is usually an application process and not Init
  * Outside of a container the same process will be seen by host as different ProcessID

<sxh bash>docker run <img> /bin/bash -c "command" # Run a command in a container</sxh>

<sxh bash>
docker commit <img_ID> <name>           # Takes the changes and creates new image called fridge
docker save -o /tmp/<name>.tar <img_ID> # Save image to a file (tar)
docker load -i /tmp/<name>.tar          # Import image
</sxh>

^Command ^What it does |
|-d| Detached, in the background|
|-it| Interactive with pseudo terminal|
|-p| Specify port(s) Ex. ''-p 80:3000'' maps port 80 of host to 3000 in a container|

===Container Management===
''Ctr+P+Q'' - Get back to terminal of docker host without terminating container

^Options ^What it does |
|docker stop <img_ID> | Gracefully stop a container (SIGTERM to PID1)|
|docker start <img_ID>| Start docker container|
|docker restart <img_ID>| Restart container|
|docker attach <img_ID>| Attach to a PID1 inside container ''AVOID'' Use docker exec instead|
|docker ''exec'' -it <img_ID> /bin/bash| Enter the container using Bash|
|docker rm <img_ID>| Delete a container (Can't be running)|
|docker ps <img_ID>| Process list from a container|
|docker logs ID/Name| Shows logs for a container. Follow a log with: **docker logs -f <ID>**|
|docker inspect <ID>| Low level info about a container|
|docker history <ID>| Lists "events", things that happened in a container|

===Dockerfile===
Allows for creating images using the plain text Dockerfile.

^Command ^Parameter|
|#|Comment|
|FROM| Base Image to base the container on|
|RUN| Build-time actions (apt-get -y instal, yum update, etc). Each RUN command will create layer in an image (use && to avoid)|
|CMD| Run-time command. Shell or Exec form. Will be overwritten by a command at the end of docker run <command> ''Exec'' form (preferred): **["echo","Hello World"]** Variables will not be expanded|
|ENTRYPOINT| Run-time command. Can't be overwritten by docker run commands. Those commands will be interpreted as arguments to ENTRYPOINT instructions.|

===Docker Registry===
You need to tag your image correctly first with your registryhost:

<sxh>docker tag [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG] [REGISTRYHOST/][USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG]</sxh>
Then docker push using that same tag.
<sxh bash>docker push NAME[:TAG]</sxh>
Example:
<sxh bash>
docker tag myImage myRegistry.com/myImage
docker push myRegistry.com/myImage
</sxh>
