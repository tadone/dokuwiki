====Docker====
  * One process per container (usually). Containers exists while processes inside of them are running. Once they stop the container will stop as well.
  * Only top layer is writable using the Union Mounts
  * **PID1** (ProcessID1 inside a container) is usually an application process and not Init
  * Outside of a container the same process will be seen by host as different ProcessID

<sxh bash>docker run <img> /bin/bash -c "command" # Run a command in a container</sxh>

<sxh bash>
docker commit <img_ID> <name>           # Takes the changes and creates new image called fridge
docker save -o /tmp/<name>.tar <img_ID> # Save image to a file (tar)
docker load -i /tmp/<name>.tar          # Import image
</sxh>
