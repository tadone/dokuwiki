===== Break a string over multiple lines =====
**Block scalar styles (>, |)**

These allow escaping, and add a new line (\n) to the end of your string.

''>'' Folded style removes the newlines within the string (but adds one at the end):
<code>
Key: >
  this is my very very very
  long string
</code>
→ this is my very very very long string''\n''

''|'' Literal style turns newlines within the string into literal newlines, and adds one at the end:
<code>
Key: |
  this is my very very very 
  long string
</code>
→ this is my very very very''\n''long string''\n''
