**Copy Mode**

Enter copy mode with ''PREFIX [''. Jump around the buffer by scrolling or searching (? and /) and grab text with ''Space'' and ''Enter''. Then paste with ''PREFIX ]''.

Plus, you can turn on Vim-like bindings (setw -g mode-keys vi) to make moving around the buffer easy.

**Scrolling Back**

''Ctrl-a'' then ''['' then you can use your normal navigation keys to scroll around (eg. Up Arrow or PgDn). Press ''q'' to quit scroll mode.

Alternatively you can press ''Ctrl-a PgUp'' to go directly into copy mode and scroll one page up (which is what it sounds like you will want most of the time)
