==== Find ====
Find regular file (f) in current directory (.) and print to STDOUT on same line (no new line)
<code bash>find . -type f -print0</code>
<code>
-print0
       True;  print  the  full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of
       the newline character that -print uses).  This allows file names that contain  newlines  or  other
       types  of  white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the find output.  This
       option corresponds to the -0 option of xargs.

==== Tar - Tape Archive====
Examples:
<code bash>
  tar -cf archive.tar foo bar  # Create archive.tar from files foo and bar.
  tar -czvf archive.tar.gz     # Create Gzipped archive.tar
  tar -tvf archive.tar         # List all files in archive.tar verbosely.
  tar -xf archive.tar          # Extract all files from archive.tar.
  tar -czvf files.tar.gz -C /vaw/www/html . # Change to /var/www/html directory and tar all files (using . "dot") 
  tar -czvf site1.tar.gz -C /var/www/ site1 
  # Note the space, I'm still using the -C, to cd to the parent dir, and specifying the dir to tar instead of dot 
</code>
==== Rsync - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool====
<code>rsync --archive --delete /path/to/source /path/to/destination

-a, --archive
       This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way  of  saying  you  want  recursion  and  want  to
       preserve  almost  everything  (with -H being a notable omission).  The only exception to the above
       equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case -r is not implied.

       Note that -a does not preserve hardlinks, because finding multiply-linked files is expensive.  You
       must separately specify -H.

====Edit file with SED==== 
[[linux:sed|Sed]]
is stream editor, but can edit files directly too, with the following:

<code>sed -i -e 's|foo|bar|g' filename</code>

**s** is used to replace the found expression "foo" with "bar"

**g** stands for "global", meaning to do this for the whole line. If you leave off the g and "foo" appears twice on the same line, only the first "foo" is changed to "bar".

**-i** option is used to edit in place on filename.

**-e** option indicates a command to run.

==== Nmap ====
[[linux:nmap|Nmap]]
==== xargs ====
''xargs'' is a command used to execute commands based on arguments from standard input.
xargs used in combination with find in order to do something with the list of files returned by find.
Recursively find all Python files and count the number of lines
<code>find . -name '*.py' | xargs wc -l</code>

Recursively find all Emacs backup files and remove them
<code>find . -name '*~' | xargs rm</code>

Recursively find all Python files and search them for the word ‘import’
<code>find . -name '*.py' | xargs grep 'import'</code>

===Handling files or folders with spaces in the name===
One problem with the above examples is that it does not correctly handle files or directories with a space in the name. This is because xargs by default will split on any white-space character. 
A quick solution to this is to tell find to delimit results with NUL (\0) characters (by supplying ''-print0'' to find), and to tell xargs to split the input on NUL characters as well (''-0'').

Remove backup files recursively even if they contain spaces
<code>find . -name '*~' -print0 | xargs -0 rm</code>

Security note: filenames can often contain more than just spaces.

===Placement of the arguments===
In the examples above xargs reads all non-white-space elements from standard input and concatenates them into the given command line before executing it. This alone is very useful in many circumstances. 
Sometimes however you might want to insert the arguments into the middle of a command. The ''-I'' flag to xargs takes a string that will be replaced with the supplied input before the command is executed. 
A common choice is {}.

Move all backup files somewhere else
<code>find . -name '*~' -print 0 | xargs -0 -I {} cp {} ~/backups</code>
