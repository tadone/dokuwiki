====Fail2Ban====

findtime is the moving window within which fail2ban keeps track of failed login attempts. If findtime is set to 10 minutes, and the host only triggers a failed login every 11 minutes, a ban will never occur.

The default findtime is 600 seconds (10 minutes). I jacked it up to 10800 (3 hours).

I also increased my bantime to 6 hours (21600 seconds).

Here are the relevant lines from the [DEFAULT] section of my /etc/fail2ban/jail.local file:

[DEFAULT]

...\\
''# 3 hours = 3600*3 = 10800\\
findtime = 10800\\
# 6 hours = 3600*6 = 21600\\
bantime = 21600\\
maxretry = 3''


Youâ€™ll need to restart fail2ban in order for the changes to take effect:

''$ /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart''

You can tail your fail2ban log during the restart to make sure your changes took:

''$ tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log''
