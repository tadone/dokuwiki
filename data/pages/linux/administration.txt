====Managing Software & Services====
Find installed package:
<code bash>rpm -qa | grep <package_name> # Query all installed packages and grep by package name</code>
Start and stop services and configure services to start automatically at boot
<sxh bash>systemctl start/stop/enable/status httpd # Start, Stop, Enable, and Status of Service
systemctl is-active/is-enabled httpd</sxh>
SystemCTL to manage services:
<sxh bash>
systemctl list-units -t service --state=active # Lists all services that are active
systemctl list-unit-files -t service --state=enabled # Lists all services that are enabled
</sxh>

===Managing Services===
A **service** can be several processes, e.g., httpd (web-service) or a database. Splitting a service into multiple processes is done for performance reasons.

**Process** - Process is a running program. At a particular instant of time, it can be either running, sleeping, or zombie (completed process, but waiting for it's parent process to pick up the return value).

A **daemon** is a subset of services that always run in memory waiting to service a request.

List all services:
<code bash>service â€“status-all</code>
Start a service:
<code bash>service httpd start</code>
Alternatively start:
<code bash>/etc/init.d/httpd start</code>

====System Configuration====
===Change hostname===
<code>hostname new-server-name-here</code>

Next edit the /etc/hostname file and update hostname:
<code>vi /etc/hostname</code>

Finally, edit the /etc/hosts file and update the lines that reads your old-host-name:
<code>vi /etc/hosts</code>

From:\\
''127.0.1.1 old-host-name''\\
To:\\
''127.0.1.1 new-server-name-here''

**Using SystemD**
<code>hostnamectl set-hostname new-server-name</code>

====Add Repo to RHEL/CentOS====
Repo files are stored in ''/etc/yum.repos.d/'' directory with ''.repo'' extension. Edit to enable/disable GPG key checking.

Use **yum-config-manager** to add repo by URL:
<code bash>yum-config-manager --add-repo http://www.example.com/example.repo</code>
Easier solution is to download and install rpm package:
<code bash>wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-latest-7*.rpm</code>

====Remove Repository from RHEL/CentOS====
To find the name of the Yum repository
<code>rpm -qf /etc/yum.repos.d/RepoName.repo</code>
Then use yum to remove the repository
<code>
rpm -qf /etc/yum.repos.d/rpmforge.repo
rpmforge-release-0.5.1-1.el5.rf
yum remove rpmforge-release</code>

Alternatively, manually remove the .repo files (example is **epel.repo** & **epel-testing.repo**)
<code>rm epel.repo epel-testing.repo</code>
Delete GPG keys also 
<code>rm /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL
yum clean all</code>
