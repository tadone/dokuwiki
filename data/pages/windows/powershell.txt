==== Basics ====
Get current PowerShell **version**:
<code>$PSVersionTable.PSVersion</code>

===Setting Execution Policy===
Running as administrator, you can set the execution policy by typing this into your PowerShell window:
<code>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</code>
You can bypass this policy by adding ''-ExecutionPolicy ByPass'' when running PowerShell
<code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File script.ps1</code>
Set it back to restricted:
<code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted</code>

===Find in string (like grep)===
<code>Get-ChildItem | findstr 'keyword'</code>
Using regex:
<code>Get-ChildItem filename.txt | Select-String -Pattern <regexPattern></code>


So this is not really a beginner task in my opinion but it's not far. Start with this instead.
Install powershell 3.0 at a minimum, but I recommend 4.0. Install .net as well

    * Create a directory on your laptop, and make 10 random files that end in anything you choose. You can add text too them if you care but it's not required.
  * cd to that dir and run <code>get-childitem</code>
  * now write this: <code>$var = get-childitem, then type $var</code>
  * now you have the output saved in a variable called var. now type $var | get-member this will output property in that variable(note that everything in posh is an object).
  * now try to use one of the methods listed $var.FullName for example.
  * build a foreach loop: <code>foreach ($item in $var) {$item.FullName}</code>
  * now make a directory that has multiple folders like production does and mess around in the same way but using the recursive flag for get-childitem

I think this will get you pointed in the right direction, if you have questions let me know.
Edit: Google get-childitem microsofts documentation is very good and there are tons of examples for each built in cmdlet.
